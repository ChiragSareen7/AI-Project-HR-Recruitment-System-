152 INDIAN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTCarrying Capacity :  It is the measure of habitat  to indefinitely sustain a
population at a particular density. A more technical definition for carrying
capacity is the largest size of a density-dependent population for which the
population growth rate is zero. Hence, below carrying capacity, populations
will tend to increase, while they will decrease above carrying capacity.
Population size decreases above carrying capacity due to either reduced
survivorship (e.g. due to insufficient space or food) or reproductive success
(e.g. due to insufficient food, or behavioural interactions), or both. The
carrying capacity of an environment will vary for different species in different
habitats, and can change over time due to a variety factors, including trends
in food availability, environmental conditions and space.
